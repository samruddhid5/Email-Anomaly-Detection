# Email-Anomaly-Detection
This project implements an anomaly detection system to detect unusual patterns in email data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify suspicious or anomalous email behaviors for security monitoring.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:
- Preprocess email data for analysis.
- Implement machine learning models for anomaly detection in emails.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing anomaly detection models.
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
